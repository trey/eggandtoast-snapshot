<p>Transcript: Green Bean and Blue Cheese&nbsp;Gratin</p>
<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Chef John Mitzewich for About.com Food. Today I&#8217;m going to show you a deliciously and decadent green bean and blue cheese&nbsp;gratin. </p>
<p>All right, this is one of those special occasion recipes that we make once or twice a year just to spoil ourselves. You forget you even know about butterfat. Let&#8217;s get started.
Clean the Green&nbsp;Beans</p>
<p>Bring some water to a boil, some salted water. Now, there are two ways to clean beans. You can pick the ends off; we like to call that in the business, the &#8220;grandma&#8217;s porch&nbsp;method.&#8221; </p>
<p>Or, you can take the knife, tap the ends of the beans together to straighten them up, and cut off the tips, which is how the chefs do it because it&#8217;s much faster.
Green Bean Gratin&nbsp;Ingredients</p>
<p>So we need:
1 1/2 pound green beans
3 ounces blue cheese
1 pint heavy cream
1/2 cup bread crumbs
1/4 cup melted&nbsp;butter</p>
<p>Boil the Green&nbsp;Beans</p>
<p>What we&#8217;re going to do is boil those beans for 6 minutes. So wait until the water comes to a rolling&nbsp;boil. </p>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, after 6 minutes we&#8217;re going to take what called a &#8220;spider&#8221; or some type of strainer, and you&#8217;re going to scoop those into a bowl lined with a paper towel. So those are almost tender, but not&nbsp;quite.</p>
<p>Combine the Butter and Bread&nbsp;Crumbs</p>
<p>The oven is preheated to 400F. We&#8217;re going to make some buttered bread crumbs, which is butter, bread crumbs, and a little black pepper, just a pinch, to&nbsp;taste. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you need salt in this. The blue cheese is usually pretty salty, but taste it. It&#8217;s up to you if you want to add a little salt at this point.
Combine the Gratin&nbsp;Ingredients</p>
<p>In the gratin dish, we&#8217;re going to put about a third of the crumbs down. You&#8217;re going to pile those beans on&nbsp;now. </p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t cool those in water, there&#8217;s no need. I just put them in the bowl with the paper towel so they&#8217;re dry, but still&nbsp;warm. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to pack those down and move them around until they are about as packed as I can get them. Then you are going to crumble over your cheese. And you&#8217;re going to pour over the cream.
Top the Gratin With Heavy&nbsp;Cream</p>
<p>Now let me answer my own rhetorical question: Can I use skim milk? No, you can&#8217;t. Either do this right or don&#8217;t do it. Like I said, this is a decadent, once-a-year dish for that special meal, that special dinner&nbsp;party. </p>
<p>We don&#8217;t count the calories, we&#8217;re going to just enjoy it. So top it with the cream and the rest of the&nbsp;breadcrumbs.</p>
<p>Bake the Green Bean and Blue Cheese&nbsp;Gratin</p>
<p>Put it in the hot oven for 15 minutes, and what comes out is this bubbling mass of&nbsp;goodness. </p>
<p>Now you have to be patient. If you dig right into this molten stuff you&#8217;ll have 3rd degree burns on your tongue. But if you let it cool just a little bit, the cream will recede and it will look like that, and it will be amazingly rich and&nbsp;delicious. </p>
