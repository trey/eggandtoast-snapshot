		<h1>Amish Friendship&nbsp;Bread <small>From the kitchen of <a href="../../index.html">JLeon</a></small></h1>
		
		<div class="content">
			<p>Amish Friendship Bread is a sourdough type bread in that it uses a starter.  As time progresses over a 10-day period you end up with more starter mixture.  The excess can then be used to make bread and/or some can be given away to friends and neighbors (along with instructions and the recipe and, perhaps, a sample of the bread?).  They, in turn, can continue the process and pass it along to their friends, making it a <span class="caps">TRUE</span> &#8220;Friendship Bread&#8221;&#8212;it used to be quite a common&nbsp;tradition.</p>
<p>Included here are recipes for both the starter and the actual bread recipe.  In the case of the starter it can be made one of 2 ways&#8212;with or without&nbsp;yeast.</p>
<p>Before getting to that, here is additional&nbsp;information:</p>
<p><span class="caps">WARNING</span>:  Due to their tendency to inhibit the fermentation process, <span class="caps">DO</span> <span class="caps">NOT</span> refrigerate the starter batter and <span class="caps">NEVER</span> use metal in any way, shape or form (spoons, bowls, beaters, etc.) in conjunction with the batter <span class="caps">EXCEPT</span> when baking (at which point fermentation is no longer a&nbsp;concern).</p>
<p>Keep the batter stored, at room temperature, in a glass, ceramic or plastic bowl/container and covered loosely (do not tightly seal or it may impair the fermentation process) with plastic wrap, a towel (paper or cloth), wax paper or something similar (avoid&nbsp;foil).</p>
<p>Since the batter is stored at room temperature, it may develop bacteria.  Therefore it would not be wise to sample (<span class="caps">IE</span> taste) the batter because it is possible you could get sick.  However, all of the living organisms within the batter, both the good (yeast) as well as the, potentially, bad (bacteria) are killed during the baking process, so the bread is perfectly safe to&nbsp;eat.</p>
<p>Also note, you can freeze starter mixture in 1 cup measures for later use.  It will take at least 3 hours (at room temperature) to thaw before&nbsp;using.</p>
<p>Starter&nbsp;Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>†3 cups all-purpose&nbsp;flour</li>
<li>†3 cups warm (at least room temperature but not greater than 110°F)&nbsp;milk</li>
<li>†3 cups granulated&nbsp;sugar</li>
</ul>
<p>Optionally</p>
<ul>
<li>1 (¼ ounce) package of active dry&nbsp;yeast</li>
<li>¼ cup warm (~110°F)&nbsp;water</li>
</ul>
<p>† These ingredients will be used up over a period of 10&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>Starter&nbsp;Directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Day 1 (either make the starter as directed below <span class="caps">OR</span> if starter was given to you, you may skip the remaining instructions for Day&nbsp;1)</li>
<li>Although not absolutely necessary (never having used it myself), yeast can be used both to speed up the fermentation process and/or increase the amount of fermentation, perhaps resulting in a somewhat lighter (less dense) bread.  If you choose to use the yeast, then in a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water (to activate it) for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring well to ensure that the yeast is entirely&nbsp;dissolved.</li>
<li>In a non-metal bowl, combine 1 cup each of the flour, sugar and milk (along with the yeast mixture, if opting to use&nbsp;it)</li>
<li>See above for storage&nbsp;information</li>
<li>Day 2 Stir mixture well using wooden or plastic&nbsp;spoon </li>
<li>Day 3 Stir mixture as&nbsp;before</li>
<li>Day 4 Stir mixture as&nbsp;before</li>
<li>Day 5 Add 1 cup each of flour, sugar and milk (at least at room temperature) to the starter mixture and stir&nbsp;well</li>
<li>Day 6 Stir mixture as&nbsp;before</li>
<li>Day 7 Stir mixture as&nbsp;before</li>
<li>Day 8 Stir mixture as&nbsp;before</li>
<li>Day 9 Stir mixture as&nbsp;before</li>
<li>Day 10 Add 1 cup each of flour, sugar and milk (at least at room temperature) to the starter mixture and stir well.  Divide the starter mixture into 3 containers (with approximately 1 cup per container).  At this time you can do one of several things.  You can keep one container as a starter and bake 2 loaves of bread using the recipe below.  Or you can keep one batch as a starter, bake one loaf of bread and give away the remaining batch of&nbsp;starter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bread&nbsp;Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup Amish Friendship Bread starter&nbsp;mixture</li>
<li>2 cups all-purpose&nbsp;flour</li>
<li>1 cup granulated&nbsp;sugar</li>
<li>⅔ cup vegetable oil (use your preferred&nbsp;oil)</li>
<li>½ cup&nbsp;milk</li>
<li>3&nbsp;eggs</li>
<li>2 teaspoons vanilla&nbsp;extract</li>
<li>3 teaspoons baking&nbsp;powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon baking&nbsp;soda</li>
<li>2 teaspoons&nbsp;cinnamon</li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt&nbsp;(optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>Optionally, any one or more of the&nbsp;following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 envelope of vanilla (or banana) instant pudding mix (adds some flavor as well as&nbsp;texture)</li>
<li>½ cup (of your favorite) chopped nuts and/or raisins, dried cranberries (craisins), dried cherries, dates, applesauce, chopped apples, mashed bananas, crushed (and drained) pineapple, coconut, chocolate chips, unsalted sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds (pepitas), sesame&nbsp;seeds</li>
</ul>
<p>With a little imagination, there are numerous other possibilities (poppy seeds, almond extract or orange zest, perhaps?) to add flavor/texture as well as food value to the finished&nbsp;bread.</p>
<p>Directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preheat oven to 325°F.  Generously grease and flour bottoms and sides of 2 ~9” x 5” loaf&nbsp;pans.</li>
<li>In a mixing bowl, combine all of the ingredients, mixing well.  Pour  into the 2 prepared loaf pans.  Bake for 1 hour (or until done, determined when an inserted toothpick comes out clean).  Alternately, you may bake for 45 minutes in a 350°F oven.  Optionally, sprinkle tops of loaves (while still warm) with confectioners&#8217; (powdered) sugar or with cinnamon and (granulated)&nbsp;sugar.</li>
</ul>
